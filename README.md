# Number Marriage Equality

An app that brings numbers together in holy matrimony (based on the original Python script, Number Marriage).

The marriage of numbers has come a long way. But numbers don't always want to marry other numbers: Sometimes, they want to marry letters. And, sometimes letters want to marry other letters. Some may call it crazy, but for the rest of us, it's called love.

Number Marriage Equality should really just be called Number Marriage, but we wanted to distance ourselves from our former project, which was created at a time when we had not the wisdom to concatenate numbers and letters in holy matrimony. We also didn't know how to use Github back then.

May love be with you always.
