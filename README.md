# Number Marriage Equality

An app that brings numbers together in holy matrimony (based on the original Python script, Number Marriage).

The marriage of numbers has come a long way. But numbers don't always want to marry other numbers: Sometimes, they want to marry letters. And, sometimes letters want to marry other letters. Some may call it crazy, but for the rest of us, it's called love.

Number Marriage Equality should really just be called Number Marriage, but we wanted to distance ourselves from our former project, which was created at a time when we had not the wisdom to concatenate numbers and letters in holy matrimony. We also didn't know how to use Github back then.

May love be with you always.

## TO-DOs:
* Get string interpolation working from JSON story data
* App should give you a hard time if you type 'I OBJECT!'
* Make title look less icky
* Add a 'restart' option at the very end
* If bride and groom are both numbers, marriage should culiminate in a sum
* User MUST enter both parties of marriage!
* Make font size bigger

## Potential Ideas
* Instead of just concatenating non-numbers, maybe convert letters A-F to hex
* Why can't more than 2 characters get married?
