# Number Marriage Equality

[Click here for the live version!](http://comfortcat.xyz/number-marriage-equality)

An app that brings numbers together in holy matrimony (based on the original Python script, Number Marriage).

The marriage of numbers has come a long way. But numbers don't always want to marry other numbers: Sometimes, they want to marry letters. And, sometimes letters want to marry other letters. Some may call it crazy, but for the rest of us, it's called love.

Special Note: I purposefully did NOT use Redux in this project in an attempt to learn to appreciate Redux all the better!
May love be with you always.


## TO-DOs:
* ~~components should only interpet app state, and app state should be the only thing interpreting JSON~~
* ~~Get string interpolation working from JSON story data~~
* ~~'I OBJECT!'~~
* ~~Make title look less icky~~
* ~~Add a 'restart' option at the very end~~
* ~~If bride and groom are both numbers, marriage should culiminate in a sum~~
* ~~User MUST enter both parties of marriage!~~ revised: NaNs are allowed to marry too.
* Make heart and story area sizes responsive to bride and groom
* write tests to verify all these rules are being followed
* ~~refactor handleInputAndDisplay~~
* Instead of just concatenating non-numbers, maybe convert letters A-F to hex

## Potential Ideas
* Why can't more than 2 characters get married?
