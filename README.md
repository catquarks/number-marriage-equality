[Click here for the live version!](http://comfortcat.xyz/number-marriage-equality)

An app that brings numbers together in holy matrimony (based on the original Python script, Number Marriage).

The marriage of numbers has come a long way. But numbers don't always want to marry other numbers: Sometimes, they want to marry letters. And, sometimes letters want to marry other letters. Some may call it crazy, but for the rest of us, it's called love.

May love be with you always.


## TO-DOs:
* Make heart and story area sizes responsive to bride and groom
* write tests
* Instead of just concatenating non-numbers, incorporate hex
